Swagger has a great interface that allows developers to test out the endpoints without having to download and run the node.

To generate your key, you would either need to be invited by ARG to get a key or if you are testing this on your local environment, you can checkout the estuary source, build it and run the set up command.

For more information on how to set up your local estuary node, visit the estuary main github repo page [here](https://github.com/application-research/estuary)

### Step 2: Open the Swagger Page on the new tab

Open the swaggerhub open api for estuary [here](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/alvin-reyes/estuary-api/1.0.0)

Once you have the API key, you would need to put this key on the Authorized modal popup.
